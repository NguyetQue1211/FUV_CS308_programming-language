# C++ Learning

This repo stores all of my notes when learning C++, and for those who want to learn this language, I believe that it would provide you with a great resource to teach yourself.  From this repo, you can find tutorials: 
1. [History and Hello World](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%201-History%20and%20Hello%20World.md)
2. [Names, Types and Binding](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%202-Names%2C%20Types%20and%20Binding.md)
3. [Selection Control Structures in C++](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%203-Selection%20Control%20Structures%20.md)
4. [Loops and Subroutines in C++](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%204-Loops%20and%20Subroutines.md)
5. [Objects and Classes](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%205%20-Objects%20and%20Classes.md)
6. [Develop "Driving Car" Game with GUI in C++ using SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer framework](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/tree/main/Game)

You can find the detailed information about my C++ Project in the following part. 

# C++ 2D Game Project
This project is part of my C++ learning journey and you can use it as a reference in case you want to build such a GUI Game using SDL2 Framework. 
* The source [code here](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/tree/main/Game)
* [Project demo](https://youtu.be/TSbwywSRN9A)
* The detailed description: below
## Project goals: 
Apply C++ Knowledge to build a simple "Driving Car" Game that allows users to navigate, direct cars so that it will not crash into obstacles. 

## Features: 
* Display scrolling Background 
* Display Player's car
* Allow user to navigate car, move forward, backward, to the right, to the left, rotate. 
* Display many cars in the opposite direction (obstacles)
* Sound Background

## Supportive frameworks
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org)
* [SDL2 image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* [SDL2 mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

## Future Development 
* Object Collision 
* Multi-levels of difficulty 
* Handle cases (conditions) to end game
