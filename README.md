# C++ Learning

This repo stores all of my notes when learning C++, and for those who want to learn this language, I believe that it would provide you with a great resource to teach yourself.  From this repo, you can find tutorials: 
1. [History and Hello World](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%201-History%20and%20Hello%20World.md)
2. [Names, Types and Binding](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%202-Names%2C%20Types%20and%20Binding.md)
3. [Selection Control Structures in C++](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%203-Selection%20Control%20Structures%20.md)
4. [Loops and Subroutines in C++](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%204-Loops%20and%20Subroutines.md)
5. [Objects and Classes](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/blob/main/PLP%205%20-Objects%20and%20Classes.md)
6. [Develop "Driving Car" Game with GUI in C++ using SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer framework](https://github.com/NguyetQue1211/FUV_CS308_programming-language/tree/main/Game)

# Project: Develop "Driving Car" Game with GUI in C++ using SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer framework
As mentioned above, this project is part of my C++ learning journey and you can use it as a reference in case you want to build such a GUI Game using SDL2 Framework. 
## Project goals: 
Apply C++ Knowledge to build a simple "Driving Car" Game that allows users to navigate, direct cars so that it will not crash into obstacles. 
## Features:
